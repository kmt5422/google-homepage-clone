This is the easy version of the first project made over at theodinproject.com
As this was the first project that I built using HTML and CSS, I felt that most of the time spent on this project was spent making sure that I had the basics down.

Things that I learned:

Using 9 divs and the CSS grid system to make the icon
Using the ::before and ::after psuedo classes to make the round edges of the search bar
The html5 layout matters

Things that could be improved:

This site is not responsive at all
